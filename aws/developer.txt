You don't need to set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in EC2 because they usually use role to get permissionI
You can use this CLI command (automatically installed)to verify your role in targte EC2:
	aws sts get-caller-identity
	{
		"Account": "137200312110",
		"UserId": "AROAR74OGT4XJA24NUIYS:i-0e387fb768f0e719d",
		"Arn": "arn:aws:sts::137200312110:assumed-role/WebServerRole/i-0e387fb768f0e719d"
	}
	
# here ec2 is assigned a role "WebServerRole"

questions:
(1) how can AWS determine target when an Internet address conflict with an VPC inner address?
